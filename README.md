# Robot-Society
Modelling a (fake robot) society hierarchy using trees.

The robots have colonized Mars and maintain a strict civilization. Citizens have subordinate-superior relationships, where one citizen may work under another. Also, some citizens are leaders of a specific district within the society. All citizens that work under a leader are considered part of that district. Note that a district could be a geographical area, or just a domain of responsibility, like Finance.
